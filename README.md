# 📘 Next.js Project Setup and Basics

## 🔰 Introduction

Welcome to the **Next.js Project Setup and Basics** repository. This project serves as a comprehensive guide to setting up and working with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It's designed for developers who want to learn the core principles of modern web development using these powerful tools.

You'll build a modern web application with reusable components, dynamic routing, API integration, and a clean, scalable folder structure.
